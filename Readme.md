# @ldapjs/controls

This package provides implementations of [LDAP controls][controls]. The
primary purpose of this library is to facilitate client and server
implementations in the [`ldapjs`](https://npm.im/ldapjs) package.

## Note About API Stability

As of June 2022, this module provides an API that was directly copied from
the original code in the `ldapjs` module. This API is marked as v1.0.0. The
API is subject to drastic change in future semver major releases. The v1 release
was published as foundational work in the overall `ldapjs` project.

## Docs

At this time, one must reference the code to learn about the available
controls and their methods.
